So this is an [app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rumobile-rutgers-students/id1036544263)
we made for the sake of learning iOS and to make life slightly easier while studying at Rutgers.
Now we're using it to learn [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

## Getting Started

- First off, you'll want [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

- Then grab the React Native CLI `npm install -g react-native-cli`

- Clone this repo.

- Install things using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

- Then you can run the iOS Simulator by running `react-native run-ios` from this repo's root dir.

We use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and have some debugging
configurations set up in this repo that should just work out of the box.

The [React Native Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/) and google are your friends.

Components go in `./components` for maximum code reuse. Hopefully we start seeing `index.android.js` soon...
